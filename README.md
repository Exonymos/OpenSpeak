# OpenSpeak - A Voice-Enabled GPT-3 Chatbot

This is a Python program that can talk to you! It uses the GPT-3 technology to generate responses to your questions. You can ask it anything you want, and it will try to give you a good answer.

## How does it work?

The program listens to your voice using your computer's microphone, and then uses a tool called SpeechRecognition to turn what you say into text. It then sends that text to GPT-3, which generates a response. Finally, the program uses a tool called pyttsx3 to speak the response out loud.


## How do I use it?

- First, you need to install some software on your computer. You can follow these instructions to do that: [link to instructions]
- Open the Python script in a program called IDLE. You can double-click on the script to open it.
- You'll need to enter an API key to use GPT-3. The script will prompt you to enter it.
- Once you've entered your API key, the script will start running. It will prompt you to speak your question.
- Say your question out loud, and the script will try to answer it.
- The script will speak the answer out loud.
- If you want to stop using the script, just say "quit" or "exit" when it prompts you to speak your question.


## Important note


This program might not always work perfectly. If it doesn't understand you, or if it gives you a weird answer, don't worry! Just try asking your question again, or try a different question.
